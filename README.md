# Problem
          At Staffing Logistics there was a problem with the current state of the recruiting and hiring process.
          There needed to be a software solution that is less error prone for staffing agency recruiters when dealing with
          employee data and recruiting potential staffing employees. This solution would need to be a very intelligent system 
          that met these core requirements:
                    1. Recruiters should be able to see the best 10 candidates for a job listing at a time.
                    2. Recruiters should be able to use this system to search and filter submitted job applications
                    3. Applicants can view their job application submissions 
                    4. Applicants can recieve job recommendations based on their searches, 
                       skills that match job descriptions within the agency and their location.
# Description:

          React and Redux , Mongo DB, and Express for API creation.

# Mocha Test Driven Development

          Mocha is a framework used to run tests on single units of code written using Node.js.
          The framework uses a describe() function
          This function takes a string and a fat arrow function
          The string is used as a name to describe your test suite
          The fat arrow ( ()=> {} ) function basically encapsulates all of your tests
          for this particular test suite. Within this function you write a series
          of "it" functions which represent your tests.
